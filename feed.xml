        <title>Romance with the languages, pun intended</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;hola-amigos&quot;&gt;Hola amigos!!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still enjoying the break before my joining. Things were going slow and dull and after learning &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; last month and I was searching for something else which I could pursue.
This time I yearned to learn something in a totally new genre. I had learnt quite a few things in &lt;code&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Music&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;outdoor/indoor games&lt;/code&gt;. I was searching something totally bizarre. That’s when I thought that “Hey, I’ve learned plenty of computer languages why not go for a real spoken language this time.” That’s when I decided I’d be learning a new language, just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started looking out for the perfect language to start with. I had Japanese, German, French, and Spanish in my mind, so I started narrowing down my choices.
After a lot of research I stumbled onto one of the most beautiful Romance languages: &lt;code&gt;Spanish&lt;/code&gt;. Mostly since it is the one of the most spoken languages in the world. Most of the US speaks it which is a dream for any IT graduate to visit (&lt;code&gt;SILICON VALLEY&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Yikes!!!&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the journey started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; being my mentor, but wait did you know, you’re much more motivated to achieve a goal if you do it with someone?
Of course you guys know it, as the old adage goes “If you want to go fast go alone, but if you want to travel far go together”! So I found my grand-mother to be my partner in this journey! Yeah you read that right, my grand-mother. She’s uber cool. She retired from the &lt;code&gt;Rajasthan University&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;H.O.D.&lt;/code&gt;, Economics Department. Awesome, ikr?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of us have started this wonderful journey and practice the language every day, doing home-works, maintaining notes, revising stuff, trying to talk in Spanish with each other, confusing other family members and what not. It’s been a month or so and both of us are pretty good at elementary Español.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out learning a new language opens up your brain to so much new stuff and gives you a new perspective of looking at things, it’s an amazing experience everybody should feel!
To describe the journey in a few words I’d ask you one question “Can you imagine a new color apart from the staple 7? Of course no, right? Learning a new language is figuratively speaking seeing a new color.” Mind-boggling isn’t it? And you right there should feel this too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow me @Duolingo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/abhisheksaxena7&quot;&gt;abhisheksaxena7&lt;/a&gt; and let’s learn and compete with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Soundcloud Covers and OC&#39;s!!</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;hi-friends&quot;&gt;Hi friends,&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt; is something which calms the soul and directly soothes the mind and body together. Some like to listen to it and others who are more blessed with talents of playback, composing; make music!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My love for music started off pretty early. I was always a choir student in my school. I remember how I used to be the only guy in the front row feeling so shy as I was surrounded by 2 girls on my right and 2 on my left. I learned playing synthesiser when I was in 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; standard. Now apart from singing, I had also started playing synth in the class assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous competitions and years later I developed a taste for western music when I was introduced to one of the &lt;code&gt;cult&lt;/code&gt; band of our generation &lt;code&gt;Linkin Park&lt;/code&gt;. Then later on &lt;code&gt;EMINEM&lt;/code&gt; became my &lt;code&gt;Rap-God&lt;/code&gt;. Seeing my passion for music, my grandmother bought me my first acoustic Guitar. Now I wanted to learn &lt;strong&gt;Guitar&lt;/strong&gt;!! So there I was learning Guitar at summer classes, at the end of those 15 days I had learnt the basics of it and on the gala night of the classes I even performed with one of the most famous bands in our city &lt;code&gt;The Oceans&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well things went slow until I met one of my friend who played &lt;code&gt;Electric Guitar&lt;/code&gt;. He inspired me to learn guitar further. So I bought a shining new &lt;code&gt;ESP-F10&lt;/code&gt; and the journey continued. I joined my college band &lt;code&gt;Sarhad&lt;/code&gt; performed with them on many occasions, played as a solo artist on separate occasions. Music still remains not a hobby but a passion and the journey continues!!. Here are some of my songs which I have recorded these past few years. I hope you like them. Feel free to comment and let me know your views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could find me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://soundcloud.com/abhisheksaxena7&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; where my songs have been played more than &lt;code&gt;15K&lt;/code&gt; times and still counting :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Debut with Blogging!!</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;hello-fellas&quot;&gt;Hello Fellas!!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since past few weeks I’ve been really bored with the daily monotony. Waking up at 5, going to gym, swimming and then &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt;. I was simply &lt;strong&gt;procrastinating&lt;/strong&gt;. I even deactivated whatsapp/facebook to stop this. I started a few things like learning &lt;code&gt;Spanish&lt;/code&gt; and it felt good studying a totally new language, but the charisma, spark and excitement I felt while &lt;code&gt;programming&lt;/code&gt; was missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my last website a long time back and since then my interest in web development had also decreased, but a website for myself was long due. So one day when I stumbled onto &lt;code&gt;Jekyll&lt;/code&gt; while looking at a friend’s website created on it. I was suddenly craving to make one for myself. I started browsing about it. I had some experience using &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; but didn’t know much anything about &lt;code&gt;jekyll&lt;/code&gt; so I started googling about it, and hours and hours later this is the result in front of all of you. My own personalized Jekyll based website. Made up from scratch in less than a day :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you guys appreciate the content I’ll be posting. If you have any suggestions for this website feel free to post a comment below and let me know about the topics you’d like to read about.
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers to the new beginning!!&lt;/p&gt;
